It doesn't seem so long ago that front-end developers were employing all manner of techniques to use more than the set of system fonts on web pages. Now we have @font-face, OpenType features, a font format specifically optimised for the web, and variable fonts. These developments allow us to create rich typographic experiences for our users. But this experience comes at the cost of performance.

This talk will cover the intersection of beautiful web typography with performance. We will discuss the history of fonts on the web, how to enable rich typographic features, and how to load web fonts efficiently.
