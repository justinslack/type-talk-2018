It seems like only yesterday we were having to use all manner of image replacement techniques just to use more than the most basic set of fonts on the web. But with CSS Level 3 OpenType font features, the widely adopted WOFF format, Chromatic Fonts, and more recently OpenType variable fonts – a single font file that behaves like multiple fonts – the capabilities opening up for typography on the web are extraordinary.

In this session, Chris Lilley shows us what’s possible today, and in the near future.


Web fonts are awesome. They make your sans-serifs slabby, your headers special and your website look gorgeous. But fonts are a resource, and downloading resources always comes as a cost — if you don’t load web fonts efficiently, what you get instead are phantom underlines, blank pages, and user rage. Let’s talk about ways to avoid this, and what new platform features are here to help us deliver pretty (but also!) fast experiences to everyone.

Web fonts are difficult to get right. An often overlooked and disruptive piece of web performance, web fonts can slow down your site and leave your visitors confused and agitated. No one wants agitated visitors. In this talk we’ll discuss useful methods to render web fonts quickly and without disruption so that visitors can do what should be a simple task—read the text. After all, web fonts are not rocket science.
